"What Solomon achieves with this debut--the sharpness, the depth, the precision--puts me in mind of a syringe full of stars. I want to say about this book, its only imperfection is that it ended. But that might give the wrong impression: that it is a happy book, a book that makes a body feel good. It is not a happy book. I love it like I love food, I love it for what it did to me, I love it for having made me feel stronger and more sure in a nightmare world, but it is not a happy book. It is an antidote to poison. It is inoculation against pervasive, enduring disease. Like a vaccine, it is briefly painful, leaves a lingering soreness, but armors you from the inside out."
--NPR

"In Rivers Solomon's highly imaginative sci-fi novel An Unkindness of Ghosts, eccentric Aster was born into slavery on--and is trying to escape from--a brutally segregated spaceship that for generations has been trying to escort the last humans from a dying planet to a Promised Land. When she discovers clues about the circumstances of her mother's death, she also comes closer to disturbing truths about the ship and its journey."
--BuzzFeed

"What Solomon does brilliantly in this novel is in the creation of a society in which dichotomies loom over certain aspects of the narrative, and are eschewed by others...Hearkening back to the past in visions of the future can hold a number of narrative purposes...The past offers us countless nightmares and cautionary tales; so too, I'm afraid, can the array of possible futures lurking up ahead."
--Tor.com

"This book is a clear descendent of Octavia Butler's Black science fiction legacy, but grounded in more explicit queerness and neuroatypicality."
--AutoStraddle

"Ghosts are 'the past refusing to be forgot, ' says a character in this assured science-fiction debut. That's certainly the case aboard the HSS Matilda, a massive spacecraft arranged along the cruel racial divides of pre-Civil War America."
--Toronto Star

Aster has little to offer folks in the way of rebuttal when they call her ogre and freak. She's used to the names; she only wishes there was more truth to them. If she were truly a monster, she'd be powerful enough to tear down the walls around her until nothing remains of her world.

Aster lives in the lowdeck slums of the HSS Matilda, a space vessel organized much like the antebellum South. For generations, Matilda has ferried the last of humanity to a mythical Promised Land. On its way, the ship's leaders have imposed harsh moral restrictions and deep indignities on dark-skinned sharecroppers like Aster. Embroiled in a grudge with a brutal overseer, Aster learns there may be a way to improve her lot--if she's willing to sow the seeds of civil war.




About the Author
Rivers Solomon graduated from Stanford University with a degree in comparative studies in race and ethnicity and holds an MFA in fiction writing from the Michener Center for Writers. Though originally from the United States, they currently live in Cambridge, England, with their family. An Unkindness of Ghosts is their debut.




Reviews
Included in Los Angeles Review of Books's Reading the Rainbow: A Pride Reading List (Blue + Violet)

Included in the American Library Association's GLBTRT 2019 Over the Rainbow List

Included in Hypable's list of book recommendations related to Captain Marvel

"This novel from an exciting new voice follows Aster, who lives in the slums of a spaceship that is escorting the last survivors of humanity to a Promised Land--a journey that has taken decades so far. The vessel is segregated and cruel, and as she tries to escape, she starts discovering dark connections between her own mother's death and the fate of the ship's sovereign. Solomon has already been called a successor to Octavia Butler, rightly so."
--Elle UK

"Rivers Solomon's debut science fiction novel is cunning, dark, and unapologetic; atmospheric and visceral; the kind of story that pulls you in and doesn't let go. Aboard the HSS Matilda, a spaceship in the future, Solomon and her characters deftly tackle race, identity, sexuality, gender, poverty, and discrimination, all with thoughtful insight and thrilling intensity. This is a difficult work that pays off; the rare kind of book that stays with you for years. You should read it now--I plan to read it again."
--Shondaland

Selected by Montreal's Drawn + Quarterly for their Strange Futures Book Club

"This book thoughtfully explores race, gender, and much more, while delivering a story that you won't be able to put down."
--Bustle

"This is a dark book in which the characters are treated brutally, but also a powerful one. For me, the nuances of how Aster's peers deal with mental illness, neurodivergence, and trauma are especially fascinating."
--Barnes & Noble Sci-Fi & Fantasy Blog

"An Unkindness of Ghosts is a debut of a powerful new voice in science fiction, and a must-read for fans of Ursula Le Guin, N.K. Jemisin, Octavia Butler, and Margaret Atwood."
--BookRiot, Included in 8 Great Reads to Get Into Afrofuturism

"Perfect for: Readers who are looking for a space opera that tackles themes surrounding identity in thoughtful and fascinating ways."

Light from Uncommon Stars

Shizuka Satomi made a deal with the devil: to escape damnation, she must entice seven other violin prodigies to trade their souls for success. She has already delivered six.
When Katrina Nguyen, a young transgender runaway, catches Shizuka's ear with her wild talent, Shizuka can almost feel the curse lifting. She's found her final candidate.
But in a donut shop off a bustling highway in the San Gabriel Valley, Shizuka meets Lan Tran, retired starship captain, interstellar refugee, and mother of four. Shizuka doesn't have time for crushes or coffee dates, what with her very soul on the line, but Lan's kind smile and eyes like stars might just redefine a soul's worth. And maybe something as small as a warm donut is powerful enough to break a curse as vast as the California coastline.
As the lives of these three women become entangled by chance and fate, a story of magic, identity, curses, and hope begins, and a family worth crossing the universe for is found.

Persephone Station

Description:

Hugo Award-nominated author Stina Leicht has created a "thoroughly enjoyable" (NPR) take on space opera for fans of The Mandalorian and Cowboy Bebop in this high-stakes adventure.
Persephone Station, a seemingly backwater planet that has been largely ignored by the United Republic of Worlds, becomes the focus for the Serrao-Orlov Corporation as the planet has a few secrets the corporation tenaciously wants to exploit.
Rosie--owner of Monk's Bar, in the corporate town of West Brynner, caters to wannabe criminals and rich Earther tourists, of a sort, at the front bar. However, exactly two types of people drank at Monk's bar: members of a rather exclusive criminal class and those who sought to employ them.
Angel--ex-marine and head of a semi-organized band of beneficent criminals, wayward assassins, and washed-up mercenaries with a penchant for doing the honorable thing is asked to perform a job for Rosie. What this job reveals will affect Persephone and put Angel and her squad up against an army. Despite the odds, they are rearing for a fight with the Serrao-Orlove Corporation. For Angel, she knows that once honor is lost, there is no regaining it. That doesn't mean she can't damned well try.

DEAD SPACE:



Description
Nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award
An investigator must solve a brutal murder on a claustrophobic space station in this tense science fiction thriller from the author of Salvation Day.
Hester Marley used to have a plan for her life. But when a catastrophic attack left her injured, indebted, and stranded far from home, she was forced to take a dead-end security job with a powerful mining company in the asteroid belt. Now she spends her days investigating petty crimes to help her employer maximize its profits. She's surprised to hear from an old friend and fellow victim of the terrorist attack that ruined her life--and that surprise quickly turns to suspicion when he claims to have discovered something shocking about their shared history and the tragedy that neither of them can leave behind.
Before Hester can learn more, her friend is violently murdered at a remote asteroid mine. Hester joins the investigation to find the truth, both about her friend's death and the information he believed he had uncovered. But catching a killer is only the beginning of Hester's worries, and she soon realizes that everything she learns about her friend, his fellow miners, and the outpost they call home brings her closer to revealing secrets that very powerful and very dangerous people would rather keep hidden in the depths of space.

Men, Women, and Chain Saws


Description
From its first publication in 1992, Men, Women, and Chain Saws has offered a groundbreaking perspective on the creativity and influence of horror cinema since the mid-1970s. Investigating the popularity of the low-budget tradition, Carol Clover looks in particular at slasher, occult, and rape-revenge films. Although such movies have been traditionally understood as offering only sadistic pleasures to their mostly male audiences, Clover demonstrates that they align spectators not with the male tormentor, but with the females tormented-notably the slasher movie's "final girls"-as they endure fear and degradation before rising to save themselves. The lesson was not lost on the mainstream industry, which was soon turning out the formula in well-made thrillers.

Including a new preface by the author, this Princeton Classics edition is a definitive work that has found an avid readership from students of film theory to major Hollywood filmmakers.

Reviews
"[A] brilliant analysis of gender and its disturbances in modern horror films. . . . Bubbling away beneath Clover's multi-faceted readings of slasher, occult, and rape-revenge films is the question of what the viewer gets out of them. . . . [She] argues that most horror films are obsessed with feminism, playing out plots which climax with an image of (masculinized) female power and offering visual pleasures which are organized not around a mastering gaze, but around a more radical "victim-identified' look."---Linda Ruth Williams, Sight and Sound
"Carol Clover's compelling [book] challenges simplistic assumptions about the relationship between gender and culture. . . . She suggests that the "low tradition' in horror movies possesses positive subversive potential, a space to explore gender ambiguity and transgress traditional boundaries of masculinity and femininity."---Andrea Walsh, The Boston Globe
"Clover makes a convincing case for studying the pulp-pop excesses of 'exploitation' horror as a reflection of our psychic times."---Misha Berson, San Francisco Chronicle
"Clover actually bothers (as few have done before) to go into the theaters, to sit with the horror fans, and to watch how they respond to what appears on screen."---Wendy Lesser, Washington Post
"In her reading of both particular horror films and of film and gender theory, Clover does what every cultural critic hopes to: she calls into question our habits of seeing."---Ramona Naddaff, Artforum
"Clover, takes the most extreme genre, horror flicks, seriously. There is no condescension in this significant and probing discussion of psychology and sexuality and their role in lurid fantasy."---Desmond Ryan, Philadelphia Inquirer
"Fascinating, Clover has shown how the allegedly naïve makers of crude films have done something more schooled directors have difficulty doing - creating females with whom male veiwers are quite prepared to identify with on the most profound levels"-- "The Modern Review"
"It's easy to see why this book is considered such a landmark in film analysis."---Rod Lott, Flick Attack

Nightmare Fuel


Description
Nightmare Fuel by Nina Nesseth is a pop-science look at fear, how and why horror films get under our skin, and why we keep coming back for more.

Do you like scary movies?
Have you ever wondered why?

Nina Nesseth knows what scares you. She also knows why.
In Nightmare Fuel, Nesseth explores the strange and often unexpected science of fear through the lenses of psychology and physiology. How do horror films get under our skin? What about them keeps us up at night, even days later? And why do we keep coming back for more?
Horror films promise an experience: fear. From monsters that hide in plain sight to tension-building scores, every aspect of a horror film is crafted to make your skin crawl. But how exactly do filmmakers pull this off? The truth is, there's more to it than just loud noises and creepy images.
With the affection of a true horror fan and the critical analysis of a scientist, Nesseth explains how audiences engage horror with both their brains and bodies, and teases apart the elements that make horror films tick. Nightmare Fuel covers everything from jump scares to creature features, serial killers to the undead, and the fears that stick around to those that fade over time.
With in-depth discussions and spotlight features of some of horror's most popular films--from classics like The Exorcist to modern hits like Hereditary--and interviews with directors, film editors, composers, and horror academics, Nightmare Fuel is a deep dive into the science of fear, a celebration of the genre, and a survival guide for going to bed after the credits roll.
"An invaluable resource, a history of the horror genre, a love letter to the scary movie--it belongs on any horror reader's bookshelf." --Lisa Kröger, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Monster, She Wrote

"Leicht masterfully blends elements of space opera, cyberpunk, and westerns in 'Persephone Station.' The result is a fresh and exciting take on the genre, offering a richly detailed universe and a diverse cast of characters that will leave you eagerly turning the pages."


"What sets 'Persephone Station' apart is its deeply human characters. Leicht delves into their pasts, secrets, and motivations, making them feel real and relatable. You'll find yourself rooting for them, even as they grapple with the shades of gray in this morally complex universe."

"In a genre often criticized for its lack of strong female characters, 'Persephone Station' shines as a feminist space epic. The women in this story are fierce, independent, and central to the plot, challenging traditional gender roles and expectations."

It Came from the Closet

Description:
Through the lens of horror--from Halloween to Hereditary--queer and trans writers consider the films that deepened, amplified, and illuminated their own experiences.Horror movies hold a complicated space in the hearts of the queer community: historically misogynist, and often homo- and transphobic, the genre has also been inadvertently feminist and open to subversive readings. Common tropes--such as the circumspect and resilient "final girl," body possession, costumed villains, secret identities, and things that lurk in the closet--spark moments of eerie familiarity and affective connection. Still, viewers often remain tasked with reading themselves into beloved films, seeking out characters and set pieces that speak to, mirror, and parallel the unique ways queerness encounters the world.It Came from the Closet features twenty-five essays by writers speaking to this relationship, through connections both empowering and oppressive. From Carmen Maria Machado on Jennifer's Body, Jude Ellison S. Doyle on In My Skin, Addie Tsai on Dead Ringers, and many more, these conversations convey the rich reciprocity between queerness and horror.

Reviews
"A brilliant display of expert criticism, wry humor, and original thinking. This is full of surprises." --Publishers Weekly, starred review
"A critical text on the intersections of film, queer studies, and pop culture that will appeal to both academic and public-library audiences." --Booklist, starred review"Wonderful off-road pieces that twist and turn with skeletal precision." --Los Angeles Review of Books
"An essential look at how spooky movies so often offer solace through subversiveness." --Electric Literature "Unique and insightful." --The Daily Dead
"A really terrific collection of essays by a great selection and variety of different authors -- both fiction authors, poets, and essayists -- about the intersection between queer studies and queer identity and horror movies." --Gothamist "An impressively diverse array of queer voices contributes their opinions on how and why particular horror movies made a personal and indelible impression on them." --The Bay Area Reporter "In this wonderful and only somewhat disturbing book (the subject is horror, after all), queer and trans writers explore the horror films that have shaped them and most reflected their own experiences. Horror, the anthology argues, while often full of misogyny and anti-trans, homophobic tropes, is also uniquely subversive and queer." --Shondaland"This book is perfect for exploring the queerness of horror through a kaleidoscopic lens." --them."Weaving elegantly between passages on theory to first sexual encounters and wrenching experiences with a surrogate, the essays take surprising turns and don't look for easy answers." --BOMB Magazine
"Killers, monsters, and demons are frequently metaphors for what we don't understand about our own humanity; they're an attempt to externalize the "monstrousness" so many of us suppress within ourselves -- or that others project onto unchangeable aspects of who we are... I finished [the anthology] with a new appreciation for the horror genre." --Autostraddle
"A fantastic anthology of writing about horror, all from deliciously queer perspectives." --Ms. Magazine"A diverse collection of thoughtful and incisive essays that show that queerness and horror are natural (or occasionally, supernatural) bedfellows." --Ghouls Magazine

Description
#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - A gripping, complexly plotted thriller set within the halls of the U.S. Supreme Court, where a young law clerk finds herself embroiled in a shocking mystery crafted by one of the most preeminent judges in America--from celebrated national leader and bestselling author Stacey Abrams.
"Abrams follows in Dan Brown's footprint with this masterfully plotted thriller that unfolds like the ultimate chess match--bold move to bolder move with lives hanging in the balance."--Lisa Gardner, author of Before She Disappeared
"A first-class legal thriller, favorably compared to many of the best, starting with The Pelican Brief, which it brings to mind. It's fast-paced and full of surprises--a terrific read."--Scott Turow, author of Presumed Innocent

Avery Keene, a brilliant young law clerk for the legendary Justice Howard Wynn, is doing her best to hold her life together--excelling in an arduous job with the court while also dealing with a troubled family. When the shocking news breaks that Justice Wynn--the cantankerous swing vote on many current high-profile cases--has slipped into a coma, Avery's life turns upside down. She is immediately notified that Justice Wynn has left instructions for her to serve as his legal guardian and power of attorney. Plunged into an explosive role she never anticipated, Avery finds that Justice Wynn had been secretly researching one of the most controversial cases before the court--a proposed merger between an American biotech company and an Indian genetics firm, which promises to unleash breathtaking results in the medical field. She also discovers that Wynn suspected a dangerously related conspiracy that infiltrates the highest power corridors of Washington.

Rogue Justice


Description
NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - The #1 bestselling author of While Justice Sleeps returns with another riveting and intricately plotted thriller, in which a blackmailed federal judge, a secret court and a brazen murder may lead to an unprecedented national crisis.
"Abrams delivers another smart, zippy thriller." --Washington Post
"A thoroughly compelling take on the machinations of Washington and those covetous of power." --New York Magazine
Supreme Court clerk Avery Keene is back, trying to get her feet on solid ground after unraveling an international conspiracy in While Justice Sleeps. But as the sparks of Congressional hearings and political skirmishes swirl around her, Avery is approached at a legal conference by Preston Davies, an unassuming young man and fellow law clerk to a federal judge in Idaho. Davies believes his boss, Judge Francesca Whitner, was being blackmailed in the days before she died. Desperate to understand what happened, he gives Avery a file, a burner phone, and a fearful warning that there are highly dangerous people involved.
Another shocking murder leads Avery to a list of names - all federal judges - and, alarmingly, all judges on the FISA Court (the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court), also known as America's "secret court." It is this body which grants permission to the government to wiretap Americans or spy on corporations suspected of terrorism. As Avery digs deeper, she begins to see a frightening pattern - and she worries that something far more sinister may be unfolding inside the nation's third branch of government. With lives at stake, Avery must race the clock and an unexpected enemy to find the answer.
Drawn from today's headlines and woven with her unique insider perspective, Stacey Abrams combines twisting plotlines, wry wit, and clever puzzles to create another immensely entertaining suspense novel.

Blackwater Falls


Description
From critically acclaimed author Ausma Zehanat Khan, Blackwater Falls is the first in a timely and powerful crime series, introducing Detective Inaya Rahman.

"A gripping and compulsive mystery, but much more than that: an exploration of faith, prejudice and fear of the unknown." --Ann Cleeves, New York Times bestselling author of the Vera, Shetland and Two Rivers series
Girls from immigrant communities have been disappearing for months in the Colorado town of Blackwater Falls, but the local sheriff is slow to act and the fates of the missing girls largely ignored. At last, the calls for justice become too loud to ignore when the body of a star student and refugee--the Syrian teenager Razan Elkader--is positioned deliberately in a mosque.
Detective Inaya Rahman and Lieutenant Waqas Seif of the Denver Police are recruited to solve Razan's murder, and quickly uncover a link to other missing and murdered girls. But as Inaya gets closer to the truth, Seif finds ways to obstruct the investigation. Inaya may be drawn to him, but she is wary of his motives: he may be covering up the crimes of their boss, whose connections in Blackwater run deep.
Inaya turns to her female colleagues, attorney Areesha Adams and Detective Catalina Hernandez, for help in finding the truth. The three have bonded through their experiences as members of vulnerable groups and now they must work together to expose the conspiracy behind the murders before another girl disappears.
Delving deep into racial tensions, and police corruption and violence, Blackwater Falls examines a series of crimes within the context of contemporary American politics with compassion and searing insight.

A Publishers Weekly Best Mystery of 2022
New York Post "Required Reading"
One of "November's Most-Anticipated Books"--We Are Bookish
One of the "Top 10 Mysteries of 2022"--The Globe and Mail
One of the "8 Suspense Books for Thrill Seekers"--Canadian Living

"Impressive. . . Khan is far too good to let the narrative devolve into a cliched showdown between immigrants and xenophobic locals. And Inaya is a fabulous character--shrewd and stalwart, yes, but also complicated and fully fleshed-out, as is the marginalized Syrian community of Blackwater Falls"--New York Times Book Review, "Editor's Choice"
"In a violent, divided town, Inaya is our moral center, with an unstinting gaze. Blackwater Falls is a tense and propulsive read from the start all the way through to its surprising, piercingly sad final chapter."--Washington Post
"Stunning . . . Kahn brilliantly depicts the complexities of her characters and the tensions of a multicultural American community struggling with bias, fear, and corruption. At once suspenseful, moving, and thought-provoking, this is not to be missed."--Publishers Weekly (Starred)
"Enthralling and intense, the plot unfurls a perceptive exploration of faith, race, gender roles, immigration, intolerance, and community. This is a masterfully crafted thriller that doesn't disappoint from beginning to end."--Booklist (Starred)
"Readers who enjoy a meatier mystery that grapples with contemporary themes, along the lines of a James Lee Burke thriller, will find much to admire."--Library Journal
"Inaya is a complex, compassionate protagonist perfectly poised to helm a new series." --Kirkus Reviews
"[The] investigation is compelling, but the story's most interesting aspect is its deft exploration of the ways that ideas of race and justice intersect and the specific pressures and problems faced by Muslim American women."--Paste Magazine

All the Demons Are Here




Description
Bestselling author Jake Tapper's "absolute page-turner" (Gillian Flynn) transports readers to the 1970s underground world of cults, celebrities, tabloid journalism, serial killers, disco, and UFOs.

It's 1977. Ike and Lucy, the kids of Senator Charlie and Margaret Marder, are grown up--and in trouble.
US Marine Ike has gone AWOL after a military operation gone horribly wrong. Now he's off the grid, working on the pit crew of the moody stunt master Evel Knievel and hanging in the roughest dive bar in Montana. His sister Lucy has become the star reporter of a brand-new Washington, DC tabloid breaking stories about a serial killer and falling in with the wealthy, shady British family that owns the newspaper.
As they deal with the weirdness and menace of the time--celebrities, cults, the rise of tabloid journalism, the death of Elvis Presley, the Summer of Sam, and a time of national unease--Ike and Lucy soon realize that their worlds are not only full of compromises and bad choices, but danger. As their lives begin to spiral out of control, they also spiral towards one another. And the decisions they make could mean life and death not only for them--but also their beloved parents.

Reviews
"Jake Tapper has become a master storyteller with his dazzling skill of weaving real people and events with a cast of characters as gripping as any in fiction."
--Michael Connelly
"Jake Tapper's latest, All The Demons Are Here, is an absolute page-turner chronicling the continuing adventures of the Marder clan. Evel Knievel? Check. UFOs? Check? A serial killer stalking the nation's capital? Check. And all set during one of America's secretly weirdest years: 1977. Powered by dual protagonists Ike and Lucy Marder, the book sends the reader pinballing across America, looking for answers in a strange, post-Watergate world. Tapper's deep knowledge of American history is on display, as is his obvious love of American pop culture-- the good, the bad, and the bizarre. 'Merica, baby!!!!"
--Gillian Flynn
"Jake Tapper's All the Demons Are Here is a brilliant and beautifully written book that had me from page one and never let me go. Tapper's novel is a deeply immersive experience, an expertly written thriller that places you in a fascinating period of American history with great characters you care about and want to spend time with. In All The Demons Are Here Tapper has delivered another wickedly smart, emotional and gripping page-turning thriller after The Devil May Dance and The Hellfire Club. I will read whatever he writes."

The Bequest

Description
Fleeing a disastrous affair with a colleague in Boston, Isabel Henley moves to Scotland to begin a PhD with a renowned feminist professor--only to learn, upon arrival, that her advisor has suffered a deadly fall. Soon after, Isabel is informed that another scholar at the university is about to publish a book on her dissertation topic, leaving her disconcerted and in search of a new subject, all while struggling to acclimate to her new home abroad.

Isabel needs a good friend during such a rocky start, and finds one when she reconnects with Rose Brewster, her charismatic classmate from undergrad. But when Rose confides to Isabel that she is in trouble, and then goes missing, Isabel's already-unsteady life is sent into a tailspin. A suicide note surfaces, followed by a coded message: Rose is alive but, unless Isabel can complete the research begun before her friend's disappearance, both women will be killed by her captors.

As Isabel follows the Rose's paper trail from Genoa to Florence and, finally, to Paris, she uncovers family secrets, the legend of an enormous cursed emerald, and a chain of betrayal and treason which parallels her own perilous present. If she can put the pieces together soon, she could solve a 400-year-old mystery--and save her and her friend's lives in the process.

Combining epistolary elements, Gothic suspense, and an atmospheric "dark academia" setting, The Bequest is a gripping literary thriller that will appeal to fans of Alex Michaelides' The Maidens and Donna Tartt's The Secret History.

About the Author
Joanna Margaret is an art historian whose previous writing and scholarly work has focused on Florentine aristocrats in sixteenth-century France. She holds a PhD from the University of St. Andrews and an MFA from NYU, where Joyce Carol Oates served as her thesis advisor. The Bequest is her first novel.


Reviews
Interlocking mysteries lie at the heart of Joanna Margaret's richly atmospheric and irresistibly readable debut novel, the harrowing saga of a young American woman historian who finds herself embroiled in a Machiavellian plot reaching back to 16th century Italy. Whether evoking present-day Scotland in a windswept region overlooking the North Sea, or Renaissance Genoa in a time of vertiginous political plotting, The Bequest is filled with unexpected turns and revelations for the reader as well as the historian-heroine.--Joyce Carol Oates
Intricately plotted, exquisitely written, and brimming with atmosphere, The Bequest is a brilliant debut, as smart as it is compelling.--Tasha Alexander
A first rate mystery by a first time author. Intriguing plot and well drawn characters.--Martin Cruz Smith
There are two attractions here: the present-day academic whodunnit and the olden puzzle revealed in Renaissance letters; viewers of the Netflix series 'The Chair' will eat this up, as will readers of Philippa Gregory and Robert J. Lloyd.-- "First Clues"
Readers will eagerly await Margaret's next.-- "Publishers Weekly" (8/9/2022 12:00:00 AM)
This one will appeal to lovers of Dan Brown and Elizabeth Kostova and other mysteries of old documents and historical figures.-- "Kirkus" (9/14/2022 12:00:00 AM)

Babel


Description
Instant #1 New York Times Bestseller from the author of The Poppy War

"Absolutely phenomenal. One of the most brilliant, razor-sharp books I've had the pleasure of reading that isn't just an alternative fantastical history, but an interrogative one; one that grabs colonial history and the Industrial Revolution, turns it over, and shakes it out." -- Shannon Chakraborty, bestselling author of The City of Brass

From award-winning author R. F. Kuang comes Babel, a thematic response to The Secret History and a tonal retort to Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell that grapples with student revolutions, colonial resistance, and the use of language and translation as the dominating tool of the British empire.

Traduttore, traditore: An act of translation is always an act of betrayal.

1828. Robin Swift, orphaned by cholera in Canton, is brought to London by the mysterious Professor Lovell. There, he trains for years in Latin, Ancient Greek, and Chinese, all in preparation for the day he'll enroll in Oxford University's prestigious Royal Institute of Translation--also known as Babel.

Babel is the world's center for translation and, more importantly, magic. Silver working--the art of manifesting the meaning lost in translation using enchanted silver bars--has made the British unparalleled in power, as its knowledge serves the Empire's quest for colonization.

For Robin, Oxford is a utopia dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. But knowledge obeys power, and as a Chinese boy raised in Britain, Robin realizes serving Babel means betraying his motherland. As his studies progress, Robin finds himself caught between Babel and the shadowy Hermes Society, an organization dedicated to stopping imperial expansion. When Britain pursues an unjust war with China over silver and opium, Robin must decide...

Can powerful institutions be changed from within, or does revolution always require violence?

Reviews
"Babel has earned tremendous praise and deserves all of it. It's Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass by way of N.K. Jemisin's The Fifth Season: inventive and engaging, passionate and precise. Kuang is fiercely disciplined even when she's playful and experimental ... Like the silver bars at its heart--like empires and academic institutions both--Babel derives its power from sustaining a contradiction, from trying to hold in your head both love and hatred for the charming thing that sustains itself by devouring you." -- New York Times Book Review

"A fantastical takedown of 19th-century imperialism that's as meaty as its title. R.F. Kuang proved her prowess at blending history and magic with her debut series, The Poppy War, and she's done it once again in this sweeping novel that blends historical fantasy and dark academia...If, as Babel suggests, words contain magic, then Kuang has written something spellbinding." -- Oprah Daily

"Absolutely phenomenal. One of the most brilliant, razor-sharp books I've had the pleasure of reading that isn't just an alternative fantastical history, but an interrogative one; one that grabs colonial history and the Industrial Revolution, turns it over, and shakes it out." -- S.A. Chakraborty, bestselling author of The City of Brass

"A fantastically made work, moving and enraging by turns, with an ending to blow down walls." -- The Guardian

"Kuang follows her award-winning Poppy War trilogy with an engaging fantasy about the magic of language. Her richly descriptive stand-alone novel about an ever-expanding, alternate-world empire powered by magically enhanced silver talismans scrutinizes linguistics, history, politics, and the social customs of Victorian-era Great Britain." -- Booklist (starred review)

"It's ambitious and powerful while displaying a deep love of language and literature...Dark academia as it should be."
-- Kirkus Reviews

"The true magic of Kuang's novel lies in its ability to be both rigorously academic and consistently welcoming to the reader, making translation on the page feel as enchanting and powerful as any effects it can achieve with the aid of silver." -- Oxford Review of Books

"R.F. Kuang has written a masterpiece. Through a meticulously researched and a wholly impressive deep dive into linguistics and the politics of language and translation, Kuang weaves a story that is part love-hate letter to academia, part scathing indictment of the colonial enterprise, and all fiery revolution."

Black AF History


Description
From acclaimed columnist and political commentator Michael Harriot, a searingly smart and bitingly hilarious retelling of American history that corrects the record and showcases the perspectives and experiences of Black Americans.

America's backstory is a whitewashed mythology implanted in our collective memory. It is the story of the pilgrims on the Mayflower building a new nation. It is George Washington's cherry tree and Abraham Lincoln's log cabin. It is the fantastic tale of slaves that spontaneously teleported themselves here with nothing but strong backs and negro spirituals. It is a sugarcoated legend based on an almost true story.

It should come as no surprise that the dominant narrative of American history is blighted with errors and oversights--after all, history books were written by white men with their perspectives at the forefront. It could even be said that the devaluation and erasure of the Black experience is as American as apple pie.

In Black AF History, Michael Harriot presents a more accurate version of American history. Combining unapologetically provocative storytelling with meticulous research based on primary sources as well as the work of pioneering Black historians, scholars, and journalists, Harriot removes the white sugarcoating from the American story, placing Black people squarely at the center. With incisive wit, Harriot speaks hilarious truth to oppressive power, subverting conventional historical narratives with little-known stories about the experiences of Black Americans. From the African Americans who arrived before 1619 to the unenslavable bandit who inspired America's first police force, this long overdue corrective provides a revealing look into our past that is as urgent as it is necessary. For too long, we have refused to acknowledge that American history is white history. Not this one. This history is Black AF.

Reviews
"A razor-sharp reassessment of American history. . . . Entertainingly colloquial and impressively erudite, this meticulous survey of the American past is an invaluable resource." -- Publishers Weekly (starred review)

"Fresh eyes and bold, entertaining language combine in this authoritative, essential work of U.S. history." -- Kirkus Reviews

"A stirring correction of U.S. history. . . . Emphasizing Black survival and resistance, Harriot simplifies complex issues into easily understandable, digestible bites. . . . With blunt, entertaining, irreverent, sarcastic, and sometimes laugh-out-loud statements, Harriot provocatively explains how the United States came to be and how money-focused, self-serving intentions made it what it is today." -- Library Journal

"Michael Harriot has done it. Written a book that evokes the full range of human emotions. Laughter. Rage. Sadness. Love (of Black resistance). Hate (of anti-Blackness). More laughter. Constant thinking and connecting and discovering. What an experience. But how can this book be anything less when it is Black AF History." -- Ibram X. Kendi, Award-winning author

"This is history as it should be told: straight, no chaser; unvarnished and unembossed. Michael Harriot, the Samuel L. Jackson of the written word, strikes again, weaving fascinating facts, scathing humor and pieces of his own life story to detail the stony road we trod." -- Joy Reid, Host of The ReidOut on MSNBC

"The story we've been told about America has always been redacted. With Black AF History, Michael Harriot removes the redacted parts and replaces them with griot-level storytelling. This is what everyone wishes their high school courses were actually like. Halfway through, you realize that this is not even a book about Black history, it's about how American history is Black AF." -- Pharrell Williams, Grammy Award-winning producer and musician

Stamped from the Beginning


Description
The National Book Award winning history of how racist ideas were created, spread, and deeply rooted in American society.
Some Americans insist that we're living in a post-racial society. But racist thought is not just alive and well in America -- it is more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues, racist ideas have a long and lingering history, one in which nearly every great American thinker is complicit.
In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. He uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to drive this history: Puritan minister Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois, and legendary activist Angela Davis.
As Kendi shows, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. They were created to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial inequities.
In shedding light on this history, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose racist thinking. In the process, he gives us reason to hope.

Reviews
"We often describe a wonderful book as 'mind-blowing' or 'life-changing' but I've found this rarely to actually be the case. I found both descriptions accurate for Ibram X. Kendi's Stamped from the Beginning... I will never look at racial discrimination again after reading this marvellous, ambitious, and clear-sighted book."
--George Saunders, Financial Times, Best Books of 2017
"An engrossing and relentless intellectual history of prejudice in America.... The greatest service Kendi [provides] is the ruthless prosecution of American ideas about race for their tensions, contradiction and unintended consequences."--Washington Post
"A deep (and often disturbing) chronicling of how anti-black thinking has entrenched itself in the fabric of American society."--The Atlantic
"A staggering intellectual history of racism in America that is both rigorous and ...readable."--New Republic
"An intricate look at the history of race in the U.S., arguing that many well-meaning American progressives inadvertently operate on belief systems tinged with a racist heritage."--TIME
"Ambitious, well-researched and worth the time of anyone who wants to understand racism."
--Seattle Times
"Kendi upends many commonly held beliefs about how racism works, exploring the ideas and thinkers behind our most intractable social and cultural problem."--Boston Globe
"An altogether remarkable thesis on history, but, in ways that are both moving and immediately painful, it also reverberates with the post-election autopsy we're all conducting right now... Stamped from the Beginning is a riveting (and often rivetingly written) work, well deserving of the National Book Award."--The Stranger
"The National Book Awards show the way toward the America we want, not the one we're getting."--New York Magazine
"Kendi has done something that's damn near impossible: write a book about racism that breaks new ground, while being written in a way that's accessible to the nonacademic. If you've ever been interested in how racist ideas spread throughout the United States, this is the book to read."--The Root
"Kendi is able to decisively quell the arguments that racism is a bygone byproduct of ignorance...Kendi's writing style is plainspoken, detail-oriented, and straightforward...In the midst of leaving Jefferson and his fellows open to judgment, Kendi leaves plenty of room for self-questioning, and for drawing connections between the racist apologetics of the past and those of the present. The process makes for a compelling, thoroughly enlightening, unsettling, and necessary read."--Vox

Quetico-Superior


Description
David Brower said, Conservationists have to win again and again and again. The enemy only has to win once. The history of the Quetico-Superior region perfectly illustrates Brower's warning.
Ultimately, we get the amount of wilderness that we are willing to fight for. Quetico-Superior: A Short History and Other Stories tells the story of a century of vigilance to protect this lake land wilderness from commercial development. Other books have addressed aspects of this struggle. My book gives the reader a concise engagement with this story. And now, with the canoe country again facing a challenge to its pristine integrity, I encourage today's canoeists to consider their roles in Brower's ongoing fight.
The second part of the book is both memoir and yarn. A trip into this wilderness presents the traveler with a formidable barrier to entry: the portage. I take the reader across one of these portage trails, ascribing both meaning and humor to the experience. The remaining two essays describe the pleasure of traveling alone in this wilderness and the relief of surviving an encounter with a bear.
My book concludes with a story best told around a campfire. The story is set in the canoe country and existed in the oral tradition for nearly thirty years. The Strange Tale of John Decamp was committed to paper on a 22 hour flight home from South Africa. Many of the young canoeists who traveled with me in this wilderness were excited to be able to revisit this story, particularly those who were there for its initial telling.
I recently turned 75. Writing this book has allowed me to add my voice to the chorus of advocates who have championed this special place.
Although my days of traveling the canoe country have passed, my memories of moments in this wilderness are vivid and deeply satisfying. As a good friend wrote to me upon reviewing my manuscript: Remembering the haunting call of the loon and the stealthy glide of the canoe made me realize that my greatest regret about growing old is that I may not be able to experience another canoe trip where the hand of man has never set foot.

About the Author
Mack Van Allen is a retired high school social studies teacher. Most of his career was spent at Centerville High School in Centerville, Ohio. Mack was co-founder of Eagle & Hawk Wilderness Adventures. The company ran wilderness canoe trips for high school students in the Quetico-Superior wilderness for twenty-five years. As a result, he is intimately familiar BWCAW and the southern part of Quetico Provincial Park. Mack has also traveled in several other wilderness areas in the National Wilderness Preservation System in the United States.
Mack holds an advanced degree in Environmental Studies from Miami University and he participated in the creation of one of the first high school interdisciplinary environmental class in the country. In addition, he holds an Outdoors Educator certificate from the National Outdoors Leadership School.
Quetico-Superior: a Short History and Other Stories is Mack's first published work. The project was started forty years ago, and a current mining controversy on land adjacent to this canoe country wilderness is the reason for him completing the project now. It is his hope that the book will encourage readers to add their voice to the fight to protect wild lands for both present and future generations.


review


Quetico-Superior is a paradise for nature lovers. The region boasts an abundance of clear, blue lakes, tranquil rivers, and dense pine and birch forests. The stunning landscapes provide a sense of serenity and a chance to disconnect from the modern world.

The area offers an array of outdoor activities, including canoeing, kayaking, hiking, fishing, and camping. Paddling through its interconnected waterways is a highlight, and there are countless remote campsites along the lakeshores.

Quetico-Superior is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including moose, black bears, wolves, beavers, and various bird species. Wildlife enthusiasts will find plenty of opportunities for observation and photography.


The strict regulations in place for the Quetico Provincial Park and BWCAW are crucial for maintaining the pristine condition of this wilderness area. Visitors must obtain permits, and there are limitations on group sizes and camping locations. These rules ensure that the environment remains unspoiled.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Quetico-Superior is its remoteness and seclusion. The absence of motorized vehicles in most areas means a quieter, more peaceful experience, and a better chance to connect with nature.

Cuba


Description
WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE IN HISTORY
WINNER OF THE LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZE IN HISTORY
"Full of...lively insights and lucid prose" (The Wall Street Journal) an epic, sweeping history of Cuba and its complex ties to the United States--from before the arrival of Columbus to the present day--written by one of the world's leading historians of Cuba.
In 1961, at the height of the Cold War, the United States severed diplomatic relations with Cuba, where a momentous revolution had taken power three years earlier. For more than half a century, the stand-off continued--through the tenure of ten American presidents and the fifty-year rule of Fidel Castro. His death in 2016, and the retirement of his brother and successor Raúl Castro in 2021, have spurred questions about the country's future. Meanwhile, politics in Washington--Barack Obama's opening to the island, Donald Trump's reversal of that policy, and the election of Joe Biden--have made the relationship between the two nations a subject of debate once more.
Now, award-winning historian Ada Ferrer delivers an "important" (The Guardian) and moving chronicle that demands a new reckoning with both the island's past and its relationship with the United States. Spanning more than five centuries, Cuba: An American History provides us with a front-row seat as we witness the evolution of the modern nation, with its dramatic record of conquest and colonization, of slavery and freedom, of independence and revolutions made and unmade.
Along the way, Ferrer explores the sometimes surprising, often troubled intimacy between the two countries, documenting not only the influence of the United States on Cuba but also the many ways the island has been a recurring presence in US affairs. This is a story that will give Americans unexpected insights into the history of their own nation and, in so doing, help them imagine a new relationship with Cuba; "readers will close [this] fascinating book with a sense of hope" (The Economist).
Filled with rousing stories and characters, and drawing on more than thirty years of research in Cuba, Spain, and the United States--as well as the author's own extensive travel to the island over the same period--this is a stunning and monumental account like no other.

Reviews
"The heroes of Ada Ferrer's narrative are the island's nationalists and reformers. . . . [She] reveals a relationship that is deeper and more troubled than it may appear. . . . Yet readers will close Ms. Ferrer's fascinating book with a sense of hope. . . . moving." -The Economist "Cuba focuses on the equivocal relationship of the two countries, and presents it convincingly as symbiotic. . . . exemplary . . . [full of] lively insights and lucid prose. . . . By being equally severe with Cuban leaders and US leaders, Ms. Ferrer achieves an honorable objective: pleasing nobody by being just." -Wall Street Journal "Important. . . . rather than putting geopolitics or 'great men' at the heart of the book, Ferrer's focus is on the Cuban people, the descendants of whom are calling for libertad." -The Guardian "Ferrer's narrative history of Cuba's past 500 years is epic, authoritative, and deeply insightful. . . . [an] essential book. . . . Cuba is broad and expansive and inclusive, telling a hemisphere-wide story of colonialism, enslavement, and entangled empires, nations, and peoples-the legacies of which are still with us." -Geraldo Cadava, Public Books "This monumental new book represents another formidable piece of original scholarship. It is written, moreover, in an admirably paced narrative style, which, one suspects, will earn it pride of place among the published histories of Cuba." -Jon Lee Anderson, Foreign Affairs "An encompassing look back at Cuba, from before the arrival of Columbus to the present day. . . . a moving chronicle of the relationship between the United States and Cuba and what that's meant for both sides." -Forbes
